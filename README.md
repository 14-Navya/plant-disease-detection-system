Plant disease detection system for sustainable agriculture
Develop a CNN-based model capable of detecting and classifying plant diseases from images of leaves of various crops such as apple, cherry, grape, and corn. The model should accurately identify both healthy and diseased leaves while predicting the specific type of disease. This system will aid in precision agriculture by enabling early detection and effective disease management.
